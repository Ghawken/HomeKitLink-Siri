0.0.4

Add Device HomeKit Bridges to enable unlimited devices.
Multiple refactoring around this approach
Beginning of device selection - cutting down visible options to options that make sense.

0.0.6
Manage the startup, shutdown of multiple threads/eventsloops, bridges, attached drivers etc..
Took some subconscious help - but believe is working well.
Bridges and all attached Accessory, Accessory Driver Loops and Thread to manage - start, end, stop when device communication enabled/disabled...

0.1.8 (oops)
Add SmokeSensor
Add LeakSensor
Add CarbonMonoxide Sensor
Add Luminancy/Light Sensor (add checks for >100000 lumens reported. TODO Ideally should have a device by device conversion...)

0.2.2
Slight refactor to deviceid list to maximise speed in deviceupdate pathway (no perceived issues - but can't be quicker than list of integers)
Add Debug single device in plugin Config - enables selection of one device to track down update/homekit interface issues

0.2.13

Add Audio enabled/disable selector for cameras (some streams will fail if audio enabled)
Show current value for device states within DeviceState selector - if using showALL
Bug fix for empty string integer conversion for previous deleted device being parsed
Further Z-wave/Hue Light Testing: Changes to RGB/Temperature lights - currently if RGB running as color light color selector works, if running as White light color selector works, but doesn't change light color.
(belief this is best compromise currently - as really 2 device RGB and one White light)  Could change so that is temperature selected RGB off, White is on - however temperature won't be reflected
in the white color as this is simply the white of the bulb selected.
Further Thermostat testing addition - looking okay
Fix for C and F temperatures - HomeKit lives in Celsius.  Convert non-C thermostat temperatures.  Add Temperature unit selection option  (can change iphone to F easily in Settings Region, Temperature display units for testing)
Hours chasing the Target/Current issue where HomeKit crashes with no error/Bridge unresponding if 3 (Auto) set to CurrentValue...
[TODO Consider que and thread for setter....  currently testing with 10 clients connected and good speed.  Obviously if multiple actions selected at once may be issue, but may hit indigo issues soon thereafter anyway.
Que would allow deletion of pending events for same device.. on/off/on/on/on/off etc. - deleted all but last if onOffState call.. for example.]
TODO add Window Coverings.
Github Issue #12 Max Lengths:  Santise all names to avoid unrecognised HomeKit crash
Check for ports in use and then use another one; not extensively tested and hard to believe will be big issue.  PluginConfig allows set base port number

0.2.14
Change camera thread handling - start when cameras active/check with bridge start/bridge loading
Change the messaging regarding device adding/deleting
Add super.init() to deviceDeleted - pending answer to query
Move super.init() to beginning of deviceUpdated rather than end.
Reformatting code (beginning of tidy up)

0.2.15
Typo fix for Lightbulb - LightBulb
Device Selection screen editing/changes
Continue Device selection fine tuning - default to best guess device, add information
Bug fix for SS camera image width
Tidy up for Debug menu items - move to config window
Fix for restartBridge - left over from Device Bridge change over
Delete unused code.
Support DeviceDeleted updated, no need for DeviceAdded.
unQuarantine button - fails currently, but never say never

0.2.16
Add MenutItem to Move Accessories from one Bridge to another.  Has some small risk.
But enables recovery of devices if delete bridge or wish to delete bridge and not completely start over.
Redo Logging all Devices - shows missing and disabled bridge devices
Consider copy HomeKit Bridge devices to new bridge - is a ownerProp in HomeKit bridge plugin
Fix for Lightbulb mis-spelling brightness issue I believe
Fix for Lightbulb RGB Temperature lights all now being LightBulbs
Fix for Saturation not being given if 100 occasionally

0.2.17
Fix for camera thread exception - keep on trucking regardless
Move to subtypes expressing exactly the Accessory Subtype eg. Lightbulb subtype adjusted depending on whether Hue/ColorTemp/Light_switch
Simply Setter and DeviceUpdated

0.2.19
Renaming - more problematic than I thought it would be...
Renaming completed
More Lock testing/fine tuning...
Add support for GarageDoors - on list but never actually supported.
Add support for Fanv2 and Fan (simple) -- plugin choosens either Fanv2 (if speedControl device or brightness) or Fan Simple if simple switch
(Can always select Switch and then within App change Icon to Fan as required)

TODO
add warning and block greater than 95 accessories being added Per Bridge..


TODO
Security System
*Window Coverings/Blinds/and there is a Slat device -  also not implemented
Documentation - yucky.
Camera Device - manual entry options.. maybe... - again yucky working well for BI and likely SS
SS as final bit of SS support - need motion in SS devices - hopefully Perry is able to do

UV sensor?
Water level sensor - can hack one together with a humidifer device... haven't tried annoying
then:
Custom - thermostat for me (1 main device, multiple zones for temp only)


Done:
Fan support, Fan_switch option and Fanv2 support.
Luminance Sensor
CarbonMonoxide Sensor
Smoke Sensor
Leak Sensor
Fan
Fanv2 - minus swing and rotation direction.
Humidity - seems good
Temperature - seems good, bug fixes for strings in some plugin devices.  No conversion of C to F just presents what you have?  Could do - but can't see point.
Switches - good, also can be changed in app to other representations
ContactSensor - Window/Door open etc good
MotionSensor - good
Lights - RGB control - seems okay (more z wave RGB testing needed), Brightness etc good.  White balance - not supported, although temperature and HueLights hue work fine
Locks - seems good
Action Groups - all via switch or can change icon in HomeKit
Thermostats: Partially supported only; largely because can't test.
For my use case I will likely need to customise the device.  eg. I have one system set to auto/cool/heat with temp max, and then multiple zones
which can be off/setpoint temperature.  Cannot change auto/heat/cool for individual zones, although they do report temperature and otherwise work as a thermostat.
Ideally would reflect the main device's state or off.  Off turns off the zone, anything else - zone == main device state.  Sorry thinking outlook - that would work ideally.
Pretty custom though.   Could get away with using DoorbellId for main device state, and rest individual thermostate device.  Hmm.. this will slow me down...

Occupancy Sensor done - checked with Occupatum Plugin and any True/False onoffState device.  Works.
